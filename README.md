## Content Notes
The `/_design` directory is for content related to development of this addon, which will not be included in the final product. You can think of concept art and source files (like the `necrosis_icon.svg` file).  
The `/_download` path is content which gets downloaded to client's `garrysmod/data` path after loading the game.
